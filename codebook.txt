Study Design
===================================================
This data set is derived from experiments conducted on 30 voluneers aged between 19-48 years while they conducted six different daily activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone.
Measurements of linear acceleration in the x, y, and z direction and angular velocity in the x, y, and z direction were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The dataset was randomly partitioned into test and training sections with 30% assigned to test and the remaining 70% assigned to the train set.

Pre-processing
===================================================
- A noice filter was applied to the accelerometer and gyroscope signals and the resulting signals were sampled in fixed width sliding windows of 2.56 sec with 50% overlap.
- The acceleration signal was split into gravitational and body motion components using a Butterworth low-pass filter. A filter of 0.3Hz was applied to the gravitational component. 

Processing techniques:
===================================================
- subset all columns with mean and std in their name
- change variable names to more describtive names
- join test and train data sets
- summarized the data by taking the mean of each variable for subject and descriptionofactivity

Data Variables
===================================================

	Acceleration variables are in g's (gravity of earth = 9.80665 m/seg2
	Gyroscope variables are in rad/seg
	All measurements are normalized

	subject: int {integers 1 through 30}
	descriptionofactivity: chr {WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTTING, STANDING, LAYING}
